Unfortunately , a crime was about to be committed but at that moment Lesley was unaware of the impending event,which would affect her life so drastically for the next two years.



For the moment at least,her holiday at the cottage had been ideal. She had spent many idle hours relaxing on the deck,reading,eating  a sandwich when she was hungry and in the evening watching the sky turn from brilliant orange to peach and finally to pale purple , eventually the light becoming dim.



It was about this time that the mist would begin to rise from the cool water hiding in the dense forest that hugged the shoreline. Late evening dew glistened on every bush and soon the loons’ call would resound across the water.



She decided to take one last dip in the lake. As the cool night air touched her arms,she gave a little shiver and decided it was time to move inside.



This was to be her last evening alone as Jeff ,her former mate, would be returning Zac to her early in the morning. As the case in many marriages these days, problems had arisen between Lesley and Jeff, but they did not extend to Zac.



He was a good kid , just entering kindergarten. The couple had come to a mutual agreement , as dictated by the legal custody agreement. It stated that each parent would share Zac’s care every second weekend and this had been her weekend to be alone.



Jeff was an architech , with a high-profile reputation,who worked in downtown Toronto, a partner in a private corporation which mostly did consultant work for the university.



Lesley’s company had been hired to advertise the new science complex in order to corporate money for the proposed building. She liked her work and she harbored a secret ambition to manage her division of the company some day.



After a whirlwind courtship and a fairytale wedding the couple had settled down to an urban lifestyle.However, agter three years and one child the dreamlike marriage came smashing down . One disadvantage of being young and ambitious was tha  both of them needed to devote uuntold hours to their busy schedules.



As a result of these late hours, Lesley became suspicious of Jeff’s after hours activities. She accused him of making her part of a love triangle. The whOle miserable scene was to set the proceedings for an ugly divorce in motion.



Daydreaming about those earlier days would not help tonight.So with a shrug of her shoulders she tackled the advertising assignment she needed to complete.Tomorrow would be a busy day with Zac arri
